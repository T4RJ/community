# T4RJ Code of Conduct

As a community rooted in the values of reproductive justice, we want to make sure that we cultivate a space for growth and change. We have created this code of conduct to help us maintain our space.
This code of conduct applies to all T4RJ spaces, including group chats, private messages replied to from T4RJ channels, and engagement with other participants both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from this group at the discretion of the administrators. By being in the space, you are agreeing to the code of conduct.
If you experience any behavior that is against this code of conduct, feels iffy, or you otherwise want to talk to someone, please reach out to [t4rj@digitaldefensefund.org](mailto:t4rj@digitaldefensefund.org) or fill out this form -[https://airtable.com/shrSyhQQBBNsfVjcq](https://airtable.com/shrSyhQQBBNsfVjcq). Your complaint will remain confidential within the admin group.
## Anti-Harassment & Discrimination
This community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. We are an emphatically queer-, trans-, and non-binary-friendly space. Our community works to dismantle systems of oppression, which is necessary work since we are all part of an American culture of White Supremacy. To this end, we prohibit:
* Offensive comments or discriminatory actions related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, country of origin, ethnicity, or religion.
* Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to birth control choice or other reproductive care, general health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
* Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent.
* Screenshotting, quoting, forwarding, or otherwise sharing T4RJ content outside of the T4RJ spaces, unless you have explicit consent from everyone involved in the conversation/content creation.
## Security Rules
We make each other safer by engaging in best practices around security. To participate in T4RJ online spaces, you agree to:
* Sign up with a non-institutional email. This is required if your email is provided by a government agency, public university, or other publicly-funded institution. If you have questions about this, please consult with an admin.
* Refer additional participants only via the official application.
* Alert admins if you believe your email, device, or other point of access for this group has been compromised.
* Do not discuss any patient or case information, proprietary work or information of your employer, or any other sensitive aspects of your work on unsecured channels and/or with people you do not know.
* Escalate any case-specific discussions around self-managed abortion and other legally-sensitive issues to a secure (end-to-end encrypted) channel like Whatsapp or Signal.
## How to Engage
Autonomy, consent, and liberation are our guiding principles. We will uphold these principles in how we build this community, how we engage with each other, and how we build technology. We understand that not everyone is coming to this space with the same experiences and expectations. This section of the code of conduct is our values put into practice.
* Act in cooperation, not competitiveness. When someone makes a mistake, we offer compassionate feedback. When someone builds something, acknowledge their work – making sure to give proper credit, especially to marginalized communities.
* Center people, not technology. Our role is not to disrupt abortion access — we are organizing to better serve organizations and groups already doing this work. In short, we build with the existing community, not for it.
* Celebrate the varying paths people took to get here. We expect that our teams will be made up of people at different levels of understanding. Find a way for people to use their skills (technical and not) and energy.
* Respect that the choice of how we conduct our work carries trade-offs and numerous costs. There is seldom only one right answer or way to look at a problem.
* Don’t spam, self-promote, or otherwise post off-topic things.
## T4RJ Projects
T4RJ welcomes both existing projects and generative, experimental work. However, to maintain our status as a 501(c)3, we must ensure that T4RJ is used to promote only charitable purposes and not to confer a substantial private benefit on any party, whether an entity or an individual. We have the following guidelines for projects to be considered a T4RJ project:
* Projects should be open source or free to use, unless built by a non-profit. We encourage defaulting to publicly accessible, but understand that some projects need to be kept private.
* We encourage all projects to have movement partners as key stakeholders, and to have been requested by a movement partner (whether individual or organization).
* Not profit-driven. Our projects should serve the movement, not the other way around.
If you have a project that’s for profit, we require that:
* It addresses a need that DDF has identified, but isn’t within our scope of work.
* It is open source or creative commons.
## Legal
Below is a legal waiver our fiscal sponsor needs. The tl;dr is that you will not hold Hopewell Fund (our fiscal sponsor) liable for any harm, that volunteering for other groups on T4RJ does not mean you are volunteering for Hopewell Fund, and that you agree to use T4RJ for solely charitable purposes - which includes not using it for lobbying or partisan political activity.
If you are using T4RJ to find volunteer opportunities, your correspondence and/or ensuing relationship with nonprofit and or other third parties found on or through T4RJ ("Volunteer Organization"), including posting or acceptance of volunteer opportunities, and any other terms or conditions associated with such dealings, are solely between you and the Volunteer Organization you choose to deal with. YOU AGREE THAT HOPEWELL FUND WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS, COST, DAMAGE, OR OTHER LIABILITY OF ANY SORT INCURRED AS THE RESULT OF ANY SUCH DEALINGS, OR AS THE RESULT OF THE PRESENCE OF SUCH PARTIES ON THE T4RJ AND YOU HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY CLAIMS AGAINST HOPEWELL FUND ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH A VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATION.
