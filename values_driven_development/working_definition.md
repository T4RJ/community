# Reproductive Justice
1. 	Ability to not have children
2. 	Ability to have children
3. 	Right to raise your children in a safe environment
4. 	Right to bodily autonomy
 
# Requires that we…
1. 	Analyze power structure
2. 	Address intersecting oppressions
3. 	Center the most marginalized
4. 	Join together across issues and identities
 
## Problem Definition/Design
- Stressing partnership
- No hoarding knowledge
- Funds/PSOs must be in the room constantly.
- How does this work w/ abortion seekers?
- RJ prioritization frameworks
- Not deference, not paternalism

## Dev Process
- Accessibility; making devs realize choices aren’t values neutral
- RJ critique sessions? RJ code review
- Prioritizing stability, security performance
- Connecting RJ to delivering value
 
## Three questions we want to try to answer
1. 	Adding RJ into dev life cycle
2. 	What your app does/prioritizing via RJ values
3. 	Volunteer vs. paid positions -> who is in the room?
